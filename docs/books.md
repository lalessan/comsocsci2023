For this course, we only use books that you can access for free on line. But I encourage you to get the books and support the authors - that's how we'll keep getting new, awesome textbooks. Books are listed in the order we use them.

#### On Data Visualization
[Scientific Visualization: Python + Matplotlib](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book), by Nicolas P. Rougier
(this is a technical book, we will use it very little, but I encourage you to check it out if you are into beautiful visualisations)

#### On Network Science
[Network Science](http://networksciencebook.com/), by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi.

#### On Natural Language Processing.
